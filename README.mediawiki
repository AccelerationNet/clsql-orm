= CLSQL-ORM =
Use this package to help with introspective operations against
databases that support information_schema . It supports generating 
view-class definitions from the database schema.

This was originally clsql-postgres-introspect, though this is a bit far removed from that.

I have used this to successfully generate view-classes for PostgreSQL,
MSSQL (through freetds and unixodbc), and mysql (though with minor
bugs in mysql).

This project does not attempt to be a persistence layer. It also makes quite a few assumptions
about what should be generated and with what types that may not match your desires or existing 
notions.  As such this code might only be useful as a jumping off point for creating your own
custom clsql ORM.
